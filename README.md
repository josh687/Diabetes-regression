The objective of this dataset is to build a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes in female patients who are at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage. The model should predict whether a patient has diabetes (Outcome = 1) or does not have diabetes (Outcome = 0) based on several diagnostic measurements, including glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
